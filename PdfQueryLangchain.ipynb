Overview\\n1.1 Company overview \\nInfosys Limited (\\'the Company\\' orInfosys) provides consulting, technology, outsourcing and next-generation digital services, toenable clients toexecute strategies fortheir digital\\ntransformation. Infosys strategic objective istobuild asustainable organization that remains relevant totheagenda ofclients, while creating growth opportunities foremployees and\\ngenerating profitable returns for investors. Infosys strategy is to be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on their journey to a digital future.\\nInfosys together with its subsidiaries and controlled trusts is herein after referred to as the \"Group\".\\nThe company isapublic limited company incorporated anddomiciled inIndia andhasitsregistered office atElectronics city, Hosur Road, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India. The\\ncompany hasitsprimary listings ontheBSE Ltd. andNational Stock Exchange ofIndia Limited. Thecompany’s American Depositary Shares (ADS) representing equity shares arelisted\\non the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\\nThe Group\\'s interim condensed consolidated financial statements are approved for issue by the company\\'s Board of Directors on July 20, 2023.\\n1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements \\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared incompliance with IAS 34,Interim Financial Reporting asissued byInternational Accounting Standards\\nBoard (\"IASB\"), under thehistorical cost convention ontheaccrual basis except forcertain financial instruments which have been measured atfairvalues. Accordingly, these interim\\ncondensed consolidated financial statements donotinclude alltheinformation required foracomplete setoffinancial statements. These interim condensed consolidated financial\\nstatements should beread inconjunction with theconsolidated financial statements andrelated notes included inthecompany’s Annual Report onForm 20-F fortheyear ended March 31,\\n2023. Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where anewly issued accounting standard isinitially adopted orarevision toanexisting accounting standard requires a\\nchange in the accounting policy hitherto in use.\\nThe material accounting policy information used in preparation of the audited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes.\\n1.3 Basis of consolidation\\nInfosys consolidates entities which itowns orcontrols. Theinterim condensed consolidated financial statements comprise thefinancial statements ofthecompany, itscontrolled trusts and\\nitssubsidiaries. Control exists when theparent haspower over theentity, isexposed, orhasrights tovariable returns from itsinvolvement with theentity andhastheability toaffect those\\nreturns byusing itspower over theentity. Power isdemonstrated through existing rights thatgive theability todirect relevant activities, those which significantly affect theentity\\'s returns.\\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases.\\nThefinancial statements oftheGroup companies areconsolidated onaline-by-line basis andintra-group balances andtransactions including unrealized gain /lossfrom such transactions\\nareeliminated upon consolidation. Thefinancial statements areprepared byapplying uniform accounting policies inuseattheGroup. Non-controlling interests which represent partofthe\\nnet profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries that are not, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by the company, are excluded.\\n1.4 Use of estimates and judgments\\nThepreparation oftheinterim condensed consolidated financial statements inconformity with IFRS requires Management tomake estimates, judgments andassumptions. These estimates,\\njudgments andassumptions affect theapplication ofaccounting policies andthereported amounts ofassets andliabilities, thedisclosures ofcontingent assets andliabilities atthedate of\\ntheinterim condensed consolidated financial statements andreported amounts ofrevenues andexpenses during theperiod. The application ofaccounting policies that require critical\\naccounting estimates involving complex andsubjective judgments andtheuseofassumptions inthese financial statements have been disclosed inNote 1.5.Accounting estimates could\\nchange from period toperiod. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes inestimates aremade asManagement becomes aware ofchanges incircumstances\\nsurrounding theestimates. Changes inestimates andjudgements arereflected intheconsolidated financial statements intheperiod inwhich changes aremade and, ifmaterial, their effects\\nare disclosed in the notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.\\n1.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgments\\na. Revenue recognition \\nThe Group’s contracts with customers include promises totransfer multiple products andservices toacustomer. Revenues from customer contracts areconsidered forrecognition and\\nmeasurement when thecontract hasbeen approved, inwriting, bytheparties tothecontract, theparties tothecontract arecommitted toperform their respective obligations under the\\ncontract, andthecontract islegally enforceable. The Group assesses theservices promised inacontract andidentifies distinct performance obligations inthecontract. Identification of\\ndistinct performance obligations todetermine thedeliverables andtheability ofthecustomer tobenefit independently from such deliverables, andallocation oftransaction price tothese\\ndistinct performance obligations involves significant judgement. \\nFixed price maintenance revenue isrecognized ratably onastraight-line basis when services areperformed through anindefinite number ofrepetitive actsover aspecified period. Revenue\\nfrom fixed price maintenance contract isrecognized ratably using apercentage ofcompletion method when thepattern ofbenefits from theservices rendered tothecustomer andGroup’s\\ncosts tofulfil thecontract isnoteven through theperiod ofthecontract because theservices aregenerally discrete innature andnotrepetitive. The useofmethod torecognize the\\nmaintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.\\nTheGroup uses thepercentage-of-completion method inaccounting forother fixed-price contracts. Useofthepercentage-of-completion method requires theGroup todetermine theactual\\nefforts orcosts expended todate asaproportion oftheestimated total efforts orcosts tobeincurred. Efforts orcosts expended have been used tomeasure progress towards completion as\\nthere isadirect relationship between input andproductivity. Theestimation oftotal efforts orcosts involves significant judgement andisassessed throughout theperiod ofthecontract to\\nreflect any changes based on the latest available information.\\nContracts with customers includes subcontractor services orthird-party vendor equipment orsoftware incertain integrated services arrangements. Inthese types ofarrangements, revenue\\nfrom sales ofthird-party vendor products orservices isrecorded netofcosts when theGroup isacting asanagent between thecustomer andthevendor, andgross when theGroup isthe\\nprincipal forthetransaction. Indoing so,theGroup first evaluates whether itcontrols thegood orservice before itistransferred tothecustomer. TheGroup considers whether ithasthe\\nprimary obligation tofulfil thecontract, inventory risk, pricing discretion andother factors todetermine whether itcontrols thegoods orservice andtherefore, isacting asaprincipal oran\\nagent.\\nProvisions forestimated losses, ifany, onincomplete contracts arerecorded intheperiod inwhich such losses become probable based ontheestimated efforts orcosts tocomplete the\\ncontract.\\n6b. Income taxes \\nThe Group\\'s two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions. \\nSignificant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.\\t\\nInassessing therealizability ofdeferred income taxassets, Management considers whether some portion orallofthedeferred income taxassets will notberealized. The ultimate\\nrealization ofdeferred income taxassets isdependent upon thegeneration offuture taxable income during theperiods inwhich thetemporary differences become deductible. Management\\nconsiders thescheduled reversals ofdeferred income taxliabilities, projected future taxable income andtaxplanning strategies inmaking thisassessment. Based onthelevel ofhistorical\\ntaxable income andprojections forfuture taxable income over theperiods inwhich thedeferred income taxassets aredeductible, Management believes thatthegroup willrealize the\\nbenefits ofthose deductible differences. The amount ofthedeferred income taxassets considered realizable, however, could bereduced inthenear term ifestimates offuture taxable\\nincome during the carry forward period are reduced. (Refer to note 2.13)\\nc. Business combinations and intangible assets\\nBusiness combinations areaccounted forusing IFRS 3(Revised), Business Combinations. IFRS 3requires ustofairvalue identifiable intangible assets andcontingent consideration to\\nascertain thenetfairvalue ofidentifiable assets, liabilities andcontingent liabilities oftheacquiree. These valuations areconducted byexternal valuation experts. Estimates arerequired to\\nbemade indetermining thevalue ofcontingent consideration, value ofoption arrangements andintangible assets. These measurements arebased oninformation available attheacquisition\\ndate and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by Management. (Refer to note 2.11 and 2.10.2)\\nd. Property, plant and equipment \\nProperty, plant andequipment represent asignificant proportion oftheasset base oftheGroup. Thecharge inrespect ofperiodic depreciation isderived after determining anestimate ofan\\nasset’s expected useful lifeandtheexpected residual value attheendofitslife.Theuseful lives andresidual values ofGroup\\'s assets aredetermined byManagement atthetime theasset\\nisacquired andreviewed periodically, including ateach financial year end. Thelives arebased onhistorical experience with similar assets aswell asanticipation offuture events, which\\nmay impact their life, such as changes in technology. (Refer to note 2.8)\\ne. Impairment of Goodwill\\nGoodwill istested forimpairment onanannual basis andwhenever there isanindication thattherecoverable amount ofacash generating unit(CGUs) islessthan it’scarrying amount. For\\ntheimpairment test, goodwill isallocated totheCGU orgroups ofCGUs which benefit from thesynergies oftheacquisition andwhich represent thelowest level atwhich goodwill is\\nmonitored for internal management purposes. \\nTherecoverable amount ofCGUs isdetermined based onhigher ofvalue-in-use andfairvalue lesscost tosell. Key assumptions inthecash flow projections areprepared based oncurrent\\neconomic conditions and comprises estimated long term growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating margins.

Themethods\\nused todetermine fairvalue include discounted cash flow analysis, available quoted market prices anddealer quotes. Allmethods ofassessing fairvalue result ingeneral approximation ofvalue, and\\nsuch value may never actually be realized.\\nRefer totable ‘Financial instruments bycategory’ below forthedisclosure oncarrying value andfairvalue offinancial assets andliabilities. Forfinancial assets andliabilities maturing within oneyear\\nfrom the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\\nTheGroup recognizes lossallowances using theexpected credit loss(ECL) model forthefinancial assets andunbilled revenue which arenotfairvalued through profit orloss. Loss allowance fortrade\\nreceivables andunbilled revenues with nosignificant financing component ismeasured atanamount equal tolifetime ECL. Forallother financial assets, expected credit losses aremeasured atan\\namount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are measured at lifetime ECL.\\nThe Group determines theallowance forcredit losses based onhistorical loss experience adjusted toreflect current andestimated future economic conditions. The Group considers current and\\nanticipated future economic conditions relating to industries the Group deals with and the countries where it operates. \\nThe amount ofECL (orreversal) that isrequired toadjust theloss allowance atthereporting date totheamount that isrequired toberecorded isrecognized asanimpairment loss orgain in\\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income.\\n9Financial instruments by category \\nThe carrying value and fair value of financial instruments by categories as at June 30, 2023 were as follows:\\n(Dollars in millions) \\nAmortized \\ncostTotal   carrying value Total   fair value\\nDesignated \\nupon initial \\nrecognitionMandatoryEquity \\ninstruments \\ndesignated upon \\ninitial recognitionMandatory\\nAssets: \\nCash and cash equivalents (Refer to note 2.1)          1,501                        -

Toassess whether acontract\\nconveys theright tocontrol theuseofanidentified asset, thegroup assesses whether: (1)thecontract involves theuseofanidentified asset (2)thegroup hassubstantially allofthe\\neconomic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the group has the right to direct the use of the asset.\\nAtthedate ofcommencement ofthelease, theGroup recognizes aright-of-use asset (“ROU”) andacorresponding lease liability foralllease arrangements inwhich itisalessee,\\nexcept forleases with aterm oftwelve months orless(short-term leases) andlowvalue leases. Forthese short-term andlowvalue leases, theGroup recognizes thelease payments as\\nan operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\\nAsalessee, theGroup determines thelease term asthenon-cancellable period ofalease adjusted with anyoption toextend orterminate thelease, iftheuseofsuch option is\\nreasonably certain. The Group makes anassessment ontheexpected lease term onalease-by-lease basis andthereby assesses whether itisreasonably certain thatanyoptions to\\nextend orterminate thecontract will beexercised. Inevaluating thelease term, theCompany considers factors such asanysignificant leasehold improvements undertaken over the\\nlease term, costs relating tothetermination ofthelease andtheimportance oftheunderlying asset toGroup’s operations taking intoaccount thelocation oftheunderlying asset and\\nthe availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances.\\nCertain lease arrangements include theoptions toextend orterminate thelease before theendofthelease term.

Insuch cases, therecoverable amount isdetermined fortheCash Generating Unit (CGU) towhich theasset\\nbelongs.\\nThe lease liability isinitially measured atamortized cost atthepresent value ofthefuture lease payments. The lease payments arediscounted using theinterest rateimplicit inthe\\nlease or,ifnotreadily determinable, using theincremental borrowing rates inthecountry ofdomicile ofthese leases.

Inthese types of\\narrangements, revenue from sales ofthird-party vendor products orservices isrecorded netofcosts when theGroup isacting asanagent between thecustomer andthe\\nvendor, andgross when theGroup istheprincipal forthetransaction. Indoing so,thegroup first evaluates whether itcontrols thegood orservice before itistransferred to\\nthecustomer. The Group considers whether ithastheprimary obligation tofulfil thecontract, inventory risk, pricing discretion andother factors todetermine whether it\\ncontrols the goods or service and therefore is acting as a principal or an agent.2.17 Revenue from Operations\\nTheGroup derives revenues primarily from ITservices comprising software development andrelated services, cloud andinfrastructure services, maintenance, consulting\\nandpackage implementation, licensing ofsoftware products andplatforms across theGroup’s core anddigital offerings (together called as“software related services”) and\\nbusiness process management services. Contracts with customers are either on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixed-price or on a fixed-timeframe basis.\\nRevenues from customer contracts areconsidered forrecognition andmeasurement when thecontract hasbeen approved inwriting, bytheparties, tothecontract, the\\nparties tocontract arecommitted toperform their respective obligations under thecontract, andthecontract islegally enforceable. Revenue isrecognized upon transfer of\\ncontrol ofpromised products orservices (“performance obligations”) tocustomers inanamount thatreflects theconsideration theGroup hasreceived orexpects toreceive\\ninexchange forthese products orservices (“transaction price”). When there isuncertainty astocollectability, revenue recognition ispostponed until such uncertainty is\\nresolved.\\nThe Group assesses theservices promised inacontract andidentifies distinct performance obligations inthecontract. The Group allocates thetransaction price toeach\\ndistinct performance obligation based ontherelative standalone selling price. Theprice thatisregularly charged foranitem when sold separately isthebest evidence ofits\\nstandalone selling price. Intheabsence ofsuch evidence, theprimary method used toestimate standalone selling price istheexpected cost plus amargin, under which the\\nGroup estimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on similar services.\\nThe Group’s contracts may include variable consideration including rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The Group includes variable consideration aspart of\\ntransaction price when there isabasis toreasonably estimate theamount ofthevariable consideration andwhen itisprobable thatasignificant reversal ofcumulative\\nrevenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\\nRevenue on time-and-material and unit of work based contracts, are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably \\neither onastraight-line basis when services areperformed through anindefinite number ofrepetitive acts over aspecified period orratably using apercentage of\\ncompletion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract \\nbecause theservices aregenerally discrete innature andnotrepetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where theperformance obligations are\\nsatisfied over time isrecognized using thepercentage-of-completion method. Efforts orcosts expended areused todetermine progress towards completion asthere isa\\ndirect relationship between input andproductivity. Progress towards completion ismeasured astheratio ofcosts orefforts incurred todate (representing work performed)\\ntotheestimated total costs orefforts. Estimates oftransaction price andtotal costs orefforts arecontinuously monitored over theterm ofthecontracts andarerecognized in\\nnetprofit intheperiod when these estimates change orwhen theestimates arerevised. Revenues andtheestimated total costs orefforts aresubject torevision asthe\\ncontract progresses. Provisions forestimated losses, ifany, onincomplete contracts arerecorded intheperiod inwhich such losses become probable based ontheestimated\\nefforts or costs to complete the contract.\\nThe billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based billing and/ormilestone based progress billings. Revenues inexcess ofbilling are\\nclassified as unbilled revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as contract liabilities (which we refer to as unearned revenues).\\nInarrangements forsoftware development and related services and maintenance services, byapplying therevenue recognition criteria foreach distinct performance\\nobligation, thearrangements with customers generally meet thecriteria forconsidering software development andrelated services asdistinct performance obligations. For\\nallocating thetransaction price, theGroup measures therevenue inrespect ofeach performance obligation ofacontract atitsrelative standalone selling price. Theprice\\nthatisregularly charged foranitem when sold separately isthebest evidence ofitsstandalone selling price. Incases where theGroup isunable todetermine thestandalone\\nselling price, theGroup uses theexpected cost plus margin approach inestimating thestandalone selling price. Forsoftware development andrelated services, the\\nperformance obligations are satisfied as and when the services are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the work as it progresses.\\nCertain cloud andinfrastructure services contracts include multiple elements which may besubject toother specific accounting guidance, such asleasing guidance. These\\ncontracts areaccounted inaccordance with such specific accounting guidance. Insuch arrangements where theGroup isable todetermine thathardware andservices are\\ndistinct performance obligations, itallocates theconsideration tothese performance obligations onarelative standalone selling price basis. Intheabsence ofstandalone\\nselling price, theGroup uses theexpected cost-plus margin approach inestimating thestandalone selling price. When such arrangements areconsidered asasingle\\nperformance obligation, revenue is recognized over the period and measure of progress is determined based on promise in the contract.\\nRevenue from licenses where thecustomer obtains a“right touse” thelicenses isrecognized atthetime thelicense ismade available tothecustomer. Revenue from\\nlicenses where the customer obtains a “right to access” is recognized over the access period.\\nArrangements todeliver software products generally have three elements: license, implementation andAnnual Technical Services (ATS).When implementation services are\\nprovided inconjunction with thelicensing arrangement andthelicense andimplementation have been identified astwodistinct separate performance obligations, the\\ntransaction price forsuch contracts areallocated toeach performance obligation ofthecontract based ontheir relative standalone selling prices. Intheabsence of\\nstandalone selling price forimplementation, theGroup uses theexpected costplus margin approach inestimating thestandalone selling price.

Therefore, unbilled revenues forother fixed price contracts (contract asset) areclassified asnon-financial asset because theright to\\nconsideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.\\nInvoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue.\\nTrade receivable and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in the consolidated statement of balance sheet.\\n2.18 Unbilled Revenue\\nAs at  The Group presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\\nRevenues for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 is as follows:\\nThree months ended June 30,\\nThe Group also derives revenues from thesale ofproducts andplatforms including Finacle –core banking solution, Edge Suite ofproducts, Panaya platform, Infosys\\nEquinox, Infosys Helix, Infosys Applied AI, Infosys Cortex, Stater digital platform and Infosys McCamish – insurance platform.\\nThree months ended June 30,Particulars\\n252.19 Equity\\nAccounting policy\\nOrdinary Shares\\nTreasury Shares\\nDescription of reserves\\nRetained earnings\\nRetained earnings represent the amount of accumulated earnings of the Group. \\nShare premium\\nOther components of equity\\n2.19.2 Dividend2.19.1 Capital allocation policy\\nEffective fiscal 2020, thecompany expects toreturn approximately 85% ofthefree cash flow cumulatively over a5-year period through acombination ofsemi\\nannual dividends and/or share buyback and/or special dividends, subject toapplicable laws andrequisite approvals, ifany.

When p = d + 1 − s the proof relies on the Cayley trick, a trick which associates to X a quasi-smooth hypersurface Y in a projective vector bundle, and the Cayley Proposition (4.3) which gives an isomorphism of some primitive cohomologies (4.2) of X and Y . The Cayley trick, following the philosophy of Mavlyutov in [7], reduces results known for quasi-smooth hypersurfaces to quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties. The idea in this paper goes the other way around, we translate some results for quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties to quasi-smooth hypersurfaces, mainly the (1, 1)-Lefschetz theorem.\\n\\nAcknowledgement.

A complex orbifold of complex dimension d is a singular complex space whose singularities are locally isomorphic to quotient singularities Cd/G, for ﬁnite sub- groups G ⊂ Gl(d, C).\\n\\nDeﬁnition 2.5. A diﬀerential form on a complex orbifold Z is deﬁned locally at z ∈ Z as a G-invariant diﬀerential form on Cd where G ⊂ Gl(d, C) and Z is locally isomorphic to Cd/G around z.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the local geometry of orbifolds reduces to local G-invariant geometry. We have a complex of diﬀerential forms (A●(Z), d) and a double complex (A●,●(Z), ∂, ¯∂) of bigraded diﬀerential forms which deﬁne the de Rham and the Dolbeault cohomology groups (for a ﬁxed p ∈ N) respectively:\\n\\nker ¯∂ im ¯∂\\n\\nker d im d\\n\\nand H p,●(Z, ¯∂) ∶=\\n\\ndR(Z, C) ∶=\\n\\nH ●\\n\\nTheorem 2.6 (Theorem 3.4.4 in [4] and Theorem 1.2 in [1] ).

Let L1, . . . , Ls be line bundles on Pd Σ be the projective space bundle associated to the vector bundle E = L1 ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ Ls. It is known that P(E) is a (d + s − 1)-dimensional simplicial toric variety whose fan depends on the degrees of the line bundles and the fan Σ. Furthermore, if the Cox ring, without considering the grading, of Pd\\n\\nΣ and let π ∶ P(E) → Pd\\n\\nΣ is C[x1, . . . , xm] then the Cox ring of P(E) is\\n\\nC[x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , ys]\\n\\nMoreover for X a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety cut oﬀ by f1, . . . , fs with deg(fi) = [Li] we relate the hypersurface Y cut oﬀ by F = y1f1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + ysfs which turns out to be quasi-smooth. For more details see Section 2 in [7].\\n\\n5\\n\\nWe will denote P(E) as Pd+s−1\\n\\nΣ,X to keep track of its relation with X and Pd Σ.\\n\\nThe following is a key remark.\\n\\nRemark 4.1. There is a morphism ι ∶ X → Y ⊂ Pd+s−1 with y ≠ 0 has a preimage. Hence for any subvariety W = V(IW ) ⊂ X ⊂ Pd W ′ ⊂ Y ⊂ Pd+s−1 Σ,X such that π(W ′) = W , i.e., W ′ = {z = (x, y) ∣ x ∈ W }.\\n\\nΣ,X .

Let Y = {F = y1f1 + ⋯ + ykfk = 0} ⊂ P2k+1 associated to the quasi-smooth intersection surface X = Xf1 ∩ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∩ Xfk ⊂ Pk+2 the Hodge conjecture holds.\\n\\nΣ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface Σ .

Recall that the Cox ring of Pk+2 is contained in the Cox ring of P2k+1 Σ,X without considering the Σ ) then (α, 0) ∈ Cl(P2k+1 grading. Considering the grading we have that if α ∈ Cl(Pk+2 Σ,X ). So the polynomials deﬁning Ci ⊂ Pk+2 X,Σ but with diﬀerent degree. Moreover, by Remark 4.1 each Ci is contained in Y = {F = y1f1 + ⋯ + ykfk = 0} and furthermore it has codimension k.\\n\\nprim(X, Q), that is, there are n ∶= h1,1\\n\\ncan be interpreted in P2k+1\\n\\nΣ\\n\\ni=1 is a basis of H k,k It is enough to prove that λCi is diﬀerent from zero in H k,k prim(Y, Q) or equivalently that the cohomology classes {λCi}n i=1 do not come from the ambient space.

Σ where π ∶ (x, y) ↦ x. Hence It is easy to check that π(V ) ∩ X = Cj as a subvariety of Pk+2 [π(V ) ∩ X] = [Cj] which is equivalent to say that λCj comes from Pk+2 Σ which contradicts the choice of [Cj].\\n\\nClaim: {λCi}n\\n\\nprim(Y, Q).\\n\\nΣ,X such that λC ∈ H k,k(P2k+1\\n\\nRemark 5.2. Into the proof of the previous theorem, the key fact was that on X the Hodge conjecture holds and we translate it to Y by contradiction.

              "' Attention is All You Need is a paper published in 2017 by researchers from Google Brain. The paper introduces the Transformer, a model architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, instead of using recurrence. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. Additionally, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.'"
